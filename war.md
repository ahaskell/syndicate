## Fight Plan

1. Focus attack on a single Team in a single Room, yes yes you may have to wait to attack, this is not a race chill 	
1. Always Start on FD2 and go straght down	
1. Once a priority Target is set (check chat for priority target) attack BOTH Teams Till Target is destroyed
1. Primary Offense players should not attack low level (<60k) teams ask	for someone to clear
1. Defense Teams DO NOT ROGUE ATTACK, attack when asked to debuff or clear 
1. If no one is available to direct attacks, refer to Primary Target List to detirmine target
